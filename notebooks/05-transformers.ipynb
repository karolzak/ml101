    "- As the sequence gets longer, the hidden state must compress more and more information\n",
    "- Early information gets repeatedly transformed and can be lost or distorted\n",

    "\n",
    "The ability to process sequences in parallel and maintain direct connections has revolutionary implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Training Speed**\n",
    "- RNNs: Must process word-by-word → Can't parallelize → Slow training\n",
    "- Transformers: Process all words at once → Highly parallelizable → Fast training on GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Long-Range Dependencies**\n",
    "- RNNs: Struggle with dependencies >10-20 words apart\n",
    "- Transformers: Can handle dependencies across 100s or 1000s of words\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability**\n",
    "- RNNs: Hit diminishing returns as you make them bigger\n",
    "- Transformers: Scale beautifully to billions of parameters (GPT-3 has 175B!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why transformers have become the foundation for:\n",

    "# 1. Attention Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand *why* transformers are powerful, let's dive into *how* they work. At the heart of transformers is the **attention mechanism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Database Search Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of attention like searching a database:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imagine you're in a library looking for information about \"neural networks\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🔍 **Query**: Your search request - \"I want books about neural networks\"\n",
    "2. 🔑 **Keys**: Book titles and descriptions - what each book offers\n",
    "3. 📚 **Values**: The actual book content - the information you'll retrieve\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- You compare your **query** against each book's **key** (title/description)\n",
    "- Books with titles/descriptions matching \"neural networks\" get high relevance scores\n",
    "- You retrieve a weighted combination of **values** (content) based on these scores\n",
    "- Books highly relevant to your query contribute more to your final understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention Does the Same Thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "In transformers, each word uses this same mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**: \"What am I looking for?\" - Each word asks a question\n",
    "- **Key (K)**: \"What do I offer?\" - Each word advertises its content  \n",
    "- **Value (V)**: \"Here's my information\" - The actual information to retrieve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n",
    "- When processing \"sat\", its **query** might be: \"Who is performing this action?\"\n",
    "- The word \"cat\" has a **key** that says: \"I'm a noun, the subject\"\n",
    "- If the similarity is high, \"sat\" pays attention to \"cat\"\n",
    "- \"sat\" then retrieves \"cat\"'s **value** (semantic meaning) to build its understanding\n",

    "### Understanding Masking: Controlling What the Model Can \"See\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In many scenarios, we need to **prevent attention to certain positions**.  \n",
    "Masking is how we control which tokens can attend to which other tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Main Types of Masking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Padding Mask** (for variable-length sequences)\n",
    "  - Problem: Batches contain sentences of different lengths → pad shorter ones with special `<PAD>` tokens\n",
    "  - Solution: Mask prevents attention to padding positions\n",
    "  - Example: `[\"The cat sat\", \"Hello\"]` → `[\"The cat sat <PAD>\", \"Hello <PAD> <PAD>\"]`\n",
    "  - Mask ensures \"Hello\" doesn't waste attention on meaningless padding tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Causal Mask** (for autoregressive generation)\n",
    "  - Problem: When generating text, token at position `i` shouldn't see future tokens (positions > `i`)\n",
    "  - Solution: Mask creates a **lower triangular** pattern - position `i` only sees positions ≤ `i`\n",
    "  - This is how GPT generates: \"The cat\" → predict \"sat\" → \"The cat sat\" → predict next word\n",
    "  - During training, we can process the whole sequence in parallel while enforcing this constraint!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Masking Works Technically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying softmax, we set masked positions to `-inf`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways: Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we've learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **The Problem**: Attention is order-agnostic\n",
    "   - Without position info: \"cat chased dog\" = \"dog chased cat\"\n",
    "   - The model can't distinguish word order by itself\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ✅ **The Solution**: Add position encodings to embeddings\n",
    "   - Most modern models use learned position embeddings (like BERT, GPT)\n",
    "   - Original Transformer used sinusoidal functions (less common now)\n",
    "   - Simple formula: `final_embedding = word_embedding + position_encoding`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ✅ **Why It Works**:\n",
    "   - Each position gets its own unique vector\n",
    "   - Same word at different positions → different final representations\n",
    "   - Now the model can tell \"cat dog\" from \"dog cat\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Pipeline So Far:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Tokenize: \"The cat sat\" → [101, 2543, 2068]\n",
